# Neural Network

In this repo we design a pytorch-like Sequential model. The model can be composed using multiple layers defined in the layer.py. We illustrate how to build a neural network by implementing the Wavenet architecture. I included the Wavenet paper for conveniwnce.

1. Create an environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (to deactivate just run `deactivate`)
3. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. To run the main code: `python -m wavenet` (Modify parameters to tune the model)
